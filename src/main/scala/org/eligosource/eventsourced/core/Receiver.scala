/**
 * Stackable modification for actors to extract the `event` from a received
 * event [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message]] and calling the modified
 * actor's `receive` method with that `event`. Example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val myReceiver = system.actorOf(Props(new MyReceiver with Receiver))
 *
 *   myReceiver ! Message("foo event")
 *
 *   class MyReceiver extends Actor { this: Receiver =>

 *         val snr = sequenceNr       // sequence number of message
 *         val sid = senderMessageId  // sender message id of current message (for duplicate detection)
 *
 *         assert(snr > 0L)

 *
 * Event messages received by concrete `Receiver`s are stored in a private field
 * and can be obtained via the `message` or `messageOption` method.
 *
 * The `Receiver` trait can also be used in combination with other stackable traits of the
 * library (such as [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Confirm]] or
 * [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Eventsourced]]), for example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val myReceiver = system.actorOf(Props(new MyReceiver with Receiver with Confirm with Eventsourced { val id = ... } ))
 *
 *   class MyReceiver extends Actor { this: Receiver =>
 *     def receive: Receive = {
 *       // ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
