/**
 * Stackable modification for making an actor persistent via event-sourcing (or command-sourcing).
 * It writes any input [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message]] to a journal. Input messages
 * of any other type are not journaled. Example:
 *
 * {{{
 *  val system: ActorSystem = ...
 *  val journal: ActorRef = ...
 *  val extension = EventsourcingExtension(system, journal)
 *
 *  class MyActor extends Actor {
 *    def receive: Receive = {
 *      case msg: Message => // journaled event message
 *      case msg          => // non-journaled message
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 *  // create and register and event-sourced actor (processor)
 *  val myActor = extension.processorOf(Props(new MyActor with Eventsourced { val id = 1 } ))
 *
 *  // replay journaled messages from previous application runs
 *  extension.recover()
 *
 *  myActor ! Message("foo event") // message will be journaled
 *  myActor ! "whatever"           // message will not be journaled
 * }}}
 *
 * If the `Eventsourced` trait is used in combination with [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Receiver]]
 * or [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Emitter]], `Eventsourced` must be the last modification:
 *
 * {{{
 *  new Actor with Receiver with Eventsourced { ... }  // ok
 *  new Actor with Emitter with Eventsourced { ... }   // ok
 *  new Actor with Eventsourced with Receiver { ... }  // won't work
 *  new Actor with Eventsourced with Emitter { ... }   // won't work
 * }}}
 *
 * The `Eventsourced` trait can additionally be combined with the stackable
 * [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Confirm]] trait.
 *
 * @see [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.EventsourcingExtension]]
