 * are forwarded as well.
 *
 * Using `Multicast` is useful in situtations where mutliple processors should
 * receive the same event messages but an application doesn't want them to journal
 * these messages redundantly.

 * @param transformer function applied to received event
 *        [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message]]s before they are forwarded
