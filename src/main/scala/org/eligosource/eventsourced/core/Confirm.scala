/**
 * Stackable modification for actors that want to automatically confirm the
 * receipt of an event [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message]] from a
 * [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Channel]]. If the modified actor's
 * `receive` method successfully returns, this trait calls `confirm(true)` on
 * the received event message. If `receive` throws an exception, this trait
 * calls `confirm(false)` on the received event message and re-throws the
 * exception. Usage example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val myActor = system.actorOf(Props(new MyActor with Confirm))
 *
 *   class MyActor extends Actor {
 *     def receive = {
 *       case msg: Message => // ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * This trait can also be used in combination with other stackable traits of the
 * library (such as [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Receiver]],
 * [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Emitter]] or
 * [[org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Eventsourced]]), for example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val myActor = system.actorOf(Props(new MyActor with Receiver with Confirm with Eventsourced { val id = ... } ))
 *
 *   class MyActor extends Actor {
 *     def receive = {
 *       case event => // ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
