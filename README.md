Overview
--------

The Eventsourced library adds scalable actor state persistence and at-least-once message delivery guarantees to [Akka](http://akka.io/). With Eventsourced, stateful actors

- persist received messages by appending them to a log (journal)
- project received messages to derive current state
- usually hold current state in memory (memory image)
- recover current (or past) state by replaying received messages (during normal application start or after crashes)
- never persist current state directly (except optional state snapshots for recovery time optimization)

In other words, Eventsourced implements a write-ahead log (WAL) that is used to keep track of messages an actor receives and to recover its state by replaying logged messages. Appending messages to a log instead of persisting actor state directly allows for actor state persistence at very high transaction rates and supports efficient replication. In contrast to other WAL-based systems, Eventsourced usually keeps the whole message history in the log and makes usage of state snapshots optional.

Logged messages represent intended changes to an actor's state. Logging changes instead of updating current state is one of the core concept of [event sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html). Eventsourced can be used to implement event sourcing concepts but it is not limited to that. More details about Eventsourced and its relation to event sourcing can be found at [*How does Eventsourced persist actor state and how is this related to event sourcing*](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/wiki/FAQ#wiki-event-sourcing-comparison).

Eventsourced can also be used to make message exchanges between actors reliable so that they can be resumed after crashes, for example. For that purpose, channels with at-least-once message delivery guarantees are provided. Channels also prevent that output messages, sent by persistent actors, are redundantly delivered during replays which is relevant for message exchanges between these actors and other services.

### Building blocks

The core building blocks provided by Eventsourced are processors, channels and journals. These are managed by an Akka extension, the [EventsourcingExtension](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.EventsourcingExtension).

#### Processor

A processor is a stateful actor that logs (persists) messages it receives. A stateful actor is turned into a processor by modifying it with the stackable [Eventsourced](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Eventsourced) trait during construction. A processor can be used like any other actor.

Messages wrapped inside [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message) are logged by a processor, unwrapped messages are not logged. Wrapped messages are often referred to as *events* in this user guide. Wrapped messages can also be *commands*, as explained in section [Application](#application).

Logging behavior is implemented by the `Eventsourced` trait, a processor's `receive` method doesn't need to care about that. Acknowledging a successful write to a sender can be done by sending a reply. A processor can also hot-swap its behavior by still keeping its logging functionality.

Processors are registered at an `EventsourcingExtension`. This extension provides methods to recover processor state by replaying logged messages. Processors can be registered and recovered at any time during an application run.

Eventsourced doesn't impose any restrictions how processors maintain state. A processor can use vars, mutable data structures or STM references, for example.

#### Channel

[Channels](#channels) are used by processors for sending messages to other actors (channel destinations) and receiving replies from them. Channels

- require their destinations to confirm the receipt of messages for providing at-least-once delivery guarantees (explicit ack-retry protocol). Receipt confirmations are written to a log.
- prevent redundant delivery of messages to destinations during processor recovery (replay of messages). Replayed messages with matching receipt confirmations are dropped by the corresponding channels.

A channel itself is an actor that decorates a destination with the aforementioned functionality. Processors usually create channels as child actors for decorating destination actor references.

A processor may also sent messages directly to another actor without using a channel. In this case that actor will redundantly receive messages during processor recovery.

Eventsourced provides three different channel types (more are planned).

- Default channel
    - Does not store received messages.
    - Re-delivers uncomfirmed messages only during recovery of the sending processor.
    - Order of messages as sent by a processor is not preserved in failure cases.
- Reliable channel
    - Stores received messages.
    - Re-delivers unconfirmed messages based on a configurable re-delivery policy.
    - Order of messages as sent by a processor is preserved, even in failure cases.
    - Often used to deal with unreliable remote destinations.
- Reliable request-reply channel
    - Same as reliable channel but additionally guarantees at-least-once delivery of replies.
    - Order of replies not guaranteed to correspond to the order of sent request messages.

Eventsourced channels are not meant to replace any existing messaging system but can be used, for example, to reliably connect processors to such a system, if needed. More generally, they are useful to integrate processors with other services, as described in [this article](http://krasserm.blogspot.de/2013/01/event-sourcing-and-external-service.html).

#### Journal

A journal is an actor that is used by processors and channels to log messages and receipt confirmations. The quality of service (availability, scalability, ...) provided by a journal depends on the used storage technology. The [Journals](#journals) section below gives an overview of existing journal implementations and their development status.

### Application

The Eventsourced library doesn't impose any restrictions on the structure and semantics of [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message) payloads. Hence, persistent messages can therefore be events as well as commands. The Eventsourced [reference application](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced-example) uses both, for example.

Eventsourced fits well into applications that implement the [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) pattern and follow a [domain-driven design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/resources/what_is_ddd) (DDD) (see [reference application](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced-example)). On the other hand, the library doesn't force applications to do so and allows them to implement event-sourcing (and/or command-sourcing) without CQRS and/or DDD.

### Journals

For persisting messages, Eventsourced currently provides the following journal implementations:

Terminology
-----------

In the following, the terms *persistent actor*, *event-sourced actor*, *event-sourced processor* and *processor* are used interchangeably. Furthermore, a [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message) is often referred to as *event message*.

First steps
-----------

This section guides through the minimum steps required to create, use and recover an event-sourced actor and demonstrates the usage of channels. Code from this section is contained in [FirstSteps.scala](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-examples/src/main/scala/org/eligosource/eventsourced/guide/FirstSteps.scala) and can be executed from the sbt prompt with

    > project eventsourced-examples
    > run-nobootcp org.eligosource.eventsourced.guide.FirstSteps

Details about the `run-nobootcp` task are described [here](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/wiki/Installation#wiki-native). The legend to the figures used in this and other sections is in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-legend).

### Step 1: `EventsourcingExtension` initialization

[EventsourcingExtension](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.EventsourcingExtension) is an Akka extension provided by the Eventsourced library. It is used by applications to

- create and register event-sourced actors (called *processors* or *event processors*)
- create and register channels
- recover registered processors and channels from journaled event messages

An `EventsourcingExtension` is initialized with an `ActorSystem` and a journal `ActorRef`.

    import java.io.File
    import akka.actor._
    import org.eligosource.eventsourced.core._
    import org.eligosource.eventsourced.journal.leveldb._

    val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("example")
    val journal: ActorRef = Journal(LeveldbJournalProps(new File("target/example-1")))
    val extension: EventsourcingExtension = EventsourcingExtension(system, journal)

This example uses a [LevelDB](http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/) based journal but any other [journal implementation](#journals) can be used as well.

### Step 2: Event-sourced actor definition

Event-sourced actors can be defined as 'plain' actors i.e. they don't need to care about appending received event messages to a journal. For example,

    class Processor extends Actor {
      var counter = 0

      def receive = {
        case msg: Message => {
          counter = counter + 1
          println("[processor] event = %s (%d)" format (msg.event, counter))
        }
      }
    }

is an actor that counts the number of received event [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message)s. In Eventsourced applications, events are always communicated (transported) via event `Message`s.

### Step 3: Event-sourced actor creation and recovery

To make `Processor` an event-sourced actor, it must be modified with the stackable [Eventsourced](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Eventsourced) trait during instantiation.

    // create and register event-sourced processor
    val processor: ActorRef = extension.processorOf(Props(new Processor with Eventsourced { val id = 1 } ))

    // recover registered processors by replaying journaled events
    extension.recover()

An actor that is modified with `Eventsourced` writes event `Message`s to a journal before its `receive` method is called. The `processorOf` method registers that actor under a unique `id`. The processor `id` is defined by implementing the abstract `Eventsourced.id` member which must be a positive integer that is consistently defined across applications runs. The `recover` method recovers the state of `processor` by replaying all event messages that `processor` received in previous application runs.

### Step 4: Event-sourced actor usage

The event-sourced `processor` can be used like any other actor. Messages of type [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message) are written to the journal, messages of any other type are directly received by `processor` without being journaled.

![Event-sourced actor](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/firststeps-1.png) 

    // send event message to processor (will be journaled)
    processor ! Message("foo")

A first application run will create an empty journal. Hence, no event messages will be replayed and the `processor` writes

    [processor] event = foo (1)

to `stdout`. When the application is restarted, however, the `processor`'s state will be recovered by replaying the previously journaled event message. Then, the application sends another event message. You will therefore see

    [processor] event = foo (1)
    [processor] event = foo (2)

on `stdout` where the first `println` is triggered by a replayed event message.

### Step 5: Channel usage

![Channel](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/firststeps-2.png)

In this step, the event-sourced `processor` is extended to send out new event messages to a `destination`. It creates another event message (by making a copy of the received event message) with an updated `event` field and sends the updated message to `destination`.

    class Processor(destination: ActorRef) extends Actor {
      var counter = 0;

      def receive = {
        case msg: Message => {
          counter = counter + 1
          // …
          destination ! msg.copy(event = "processed %d event messages so far" format counter)
        }
      }
    }

    val destination: ActorRef = system.actorOf(Props[Destination])
    // instantiate processor by passing the destination as constructor argument
    val processor: ActorRef = extension.processorOf(Props(new Processor(destination) with Eventsourced { val id = 1 } ))

    extension.recover()

Without any further actions, this would also send event messages to `destination` during recovery (i.e. during replay of event messages). With every application restart, `destination` would redundantly receive the whole event message history again and again. This is not acceptable in most cases, such as when `destination` represents an external service, for example.

To prevent redundant message delivery to `destination` we need something that *remembers* which messages have already been successfully delivered. This is exactly the use case for [channels](#channels). A channel drops all messages that have already been successfully delivered to a destination. We therefore wrap `destination` by a channel and let the processor communicate with the destination via that channel. This can be done without changing the code of `Processor`.

    val destination: ActorRef = system.actorOf(Props[Destination])
    // wrap destination by channel
    val channel: ActorRef = extension.channelOf(DefaultChannelProps(1, destination))
    // instantiate processor by passing the channel (i.e. wrapped destination) as constructor argument
    val processor: ActorRef = extension.processorOf(Props(new Processor(channel) with Eventsourced { val id = 1 } ))

A channel must have a unique id (`1` in our example), a positive integer that must be consistently defined across application runs. Here, we create a [default channel](#defaultchannel) that is configured with a [DefaultChannelProps](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.DefaultChannelProps) configuration object. If applications need reliable event message delivery to destinations, they should use a [reliable channel](#reliablechannel) that is configured with a [ReliableChannelProps](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.ReliableChannelProps) configuration object.

Assuming the following definition of a `Destination` actor

    class Destination extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case msg: Message => {
          println("[destination] event = '%s'" format msg.event)
          // confirm receipt of event message from channel
          msg.confirm()
        }
      }
    }

 and that we're starting again from an empty journal, you should see

    [processor] event = foo (1)
    [destination] event = 'processed 1 event messages so far'

on `stdout` during a first application run. When running the application again, you'll see that the event-sourced `processor` receives the complete event message history but the `destination` only receives the last event message produced by `processor` (which corresponds the the single event message sent to `processor` during the current application run):

    [processor] event = foo (1)
    [processor] event = foo (2)
    [destination] event = 'processed 2 event messages so far'

When receiving event messages from a channel, destinations must confirm the receipt of that message by calling `Message.confirm()` which asynchronously writes a confirmation (an *acknowledgement*) to the journal that the message has been successfully delivered. Later, you'll also see how confirmation functionality can be added to destinations with the stackable [Confirm](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Confirm) trait.

This [First steps](#first-steps) guide is a rather low-level introduction to the Eventsourced library. More advanced library features are covered in the following sections.

Stackable traits
----------------

### `Eventsourced`

![Eventsourced](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/stackabletraits-1.png)

The [Eventsourced](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Eventsourced) trait has already been discussed in section [First steps](#first-steps). It can be combined with the stackable `Receiver`, `Emitter` and/or `Confirm` traits where the `Eventsourced` trait must always the last modification i.e.

    new MyActor with Receiver with Confirm with Eventsourced

### `Receiver`

![Receiver](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/stackabletraits-2.png)

An actor that receives event [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message)s often wants to pattern-match against the contained `event` directly instead of the whole event message. This can be achieved by modifying it with the [Receiver](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Receiver) trait during instantiation.

    class MyActor extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case event => println("received event %s" format event)
      }
    }

    val myActor = system.actorOf(Props(new MyActor with Receiver))

    myActor ! Message("foo")

In the above example, sending `Message("foo")` to `myActor` will write `received event foo` to `stdout`. The `Receiver` trait stores the received event message as *current* event message in a field, extracts the contained `event` from that message and calls the `receive` method of `MyActor` with `event` as argument. If `MyActor` wants to have access to the current event message it must be defined with a `Receiver` self-type and call the `message` method.

    class MyActor extends Actor { this: Receiver =>
      def receive = {
        case event => {
           // obtain current event message
          val currentMessage = message
          // …
          println("received event %s" format event)
        }
      }
    }

The `Receiver` trait can also be combined with the stackable `Eventsourced` and/or `Confirm` traits where `Receiver` must always be the first modification. For example:

    new MyActor with Receiver with Confirm with Eventsourced

Refer to the [API docs](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Receiver) for further details.

### `Emitter`

![Emitter](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/stackabletraits-3.png)

Where a `Receiver` modification allows actors to pattern-match against incoming events directly instead of whole event `Message`s, an [Emitter](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Emitter) introduces a corresponding simplification on the sending (outgoing) side. It allows actors to send (emit) events to channels without having to deal with whole event `Message`s. An emitter can also lookup channels by name.

    class MyActor extends Actor { this: Emitter =>
        def receive = {
          case event => {
            // emit event to channel "myChannel"
            emitter("myChannel") sendEvent ("received: %s" format event)
          }
        }
      }

    // create register channel under name "myChannel"
    extension.channelOf(DefaultChannelProps(1, destination).withName("myChannel"))

    val myActor = system.actorOf(Props(new MyActor with Emitter))

Event messages sent by an emitter to a channel are always derived from (i.e. are a copy of) the current event message (an `Emitter` is also `Receiver` and maintains a *current* event message, see also section [Receiver](#receiver)). A call to the `emitter` method with a channel name as argument creates a [MessageEmitter](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.MessageEmitter) object that captures the named channel and the current event message. Calling `sendEvent` on that object modifies the captured event message with the specified event argument and sends the updated event message to the channel (see also channel [usage hints](#usage-hints)). A `MessageEmitter` object can also be sent to other actors (or threads) and be used there i.e. a `MessageEmitter` object is thread-safe.

The `Emitter` trait can also be combined with the stackable `Eventsourced` and/or `Confirm` traits where `Emitter` must always be the first modification. For example:

    new MyActor with Emitter with Confirm with Eventsourced

Refer to the [API docs](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Emitter) for further details.

### `Confirm`

![Confirm](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/stackabletraits-4.png)

The receipt of event messages from channels must be confirmed by calling `confirm()` or `confirm(true)` on the received event `Message`. Applications can also *negatively* confirm an event message receipt by calling `confirm(false)`. This, for example, causes a reliable channel to redeliver the event message.

Instead of calling `confirm(true)` or `confirm(false)` explicitly, actors can also be modified with the stackable [Confirm](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Confirm) trait. This trait calls `confirm(true)` on the received event message when the modified actor's `receive` method returns normally and `confirm(false)` when it throws an exception.

This trait can either be used standalone

    new MyActor with Confirm

or in combination with the stackable `Receiver`, `Emitter` and/or `Eventsourced` traits where the `Confirm` modification must be made after a `Receiver` or `Emitter` modification but before an `Eventsourced` modification. For example:

    new MyActor with Receiver with Confirm with Eventsourced

Refer to the [API docs](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Confirm) for further details.

### Modified example

![Example](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/stackabletraits-5.png)

This section modifies (and simplifies) the example from section [First steps](#first-steps) by making use of the stackable `Receiver`, `Emitter` and `Confirm` traits. In particular

- `Processor` will be modified with `Emitter` (in addition to `Eventsourced`)
- `Destination` will be modified with `Receiver` and `Confirm`

Code from this section is contained in [StackableTraits.scala](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-examples/src/main/scala/org/eligosource/eventsourced/guide/StackableTraits.scala) and can be executed from the sbt prompt with

    > project eventsourced-examples
    > run-nobootcp org.eligosource.eventsourced.guide.StackableTraits

The new definition of `Processor`

    class Processor extends Actor { this: Emitter =>
      var counter = 0

      def receive = {
        case event => {
          counter = counter + 1
          println("[processor] event = %s (%d)" format (event, counter))
          emitter("destination") sendEvent ("processed %d events so far" format counter)
        }
      }
    }

now has a self-type `Emitter` and pattern-matches against events directly. Instead of passing the channel via the constructor it is now looked-up by name (`"destination"`). The channel name is specified during channel creation.

    extension.channelOf(DefaultChannelProps(1, destination).withName("destination"))

`Processor` must be instantiated with an additional `Emitter` modification to conform to the `Processor` self-type.

    val processor: ActorRef = extension.processorOf(Props(new Processor with Emitter with Eventsourced { val id = 1 } ))

The new definition of `Destination`

    class Destination extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case event => {
          println("[destination] event = '%s'" format event)
        }
      }
    }

pattern-matches against events directly and leaves event message receipt confirmation to the `Confirm` trait. `Destination` must be instantiated with a `Receiver` and a `Confirm` modification.

    val destination: ActorRef = system.actorOf(Props(new Destination with Receiver with Confirm))

Sender references
-----------------

The Eventsourced library preserves sender references for all

- message exchanges with actors that are modified with `Eventsourced`, `Receiver`, `Emitter` and/or `Confirm` and
- message exchanges with destination actors via [channels](#channels)

i.e. event-sourced actor applications can make use of sender references in the same way as plain actor applications. If you know how sender references work with Akka [actors](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.1.0/scala/actors.html), the following will sound familiar to you.

![Processor reply](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/senderrefs-1.png)

For example, taking the code from section [First steps](#first-steps) as a starting point, `Processor` can be extended to reply to message senders as follows.

    class Processor(destination: ActorRef) extends Actor {
      // …

      def receive = {
        case msg: Message => {
          // …
          // reply to sender
          sender ! ("done processing event = %s" format msg.event)
        }
      }
    }


Applications can now *ask* the `processor` and will get a response asynchronously.

    processor ? Message("foo") onSuccess {
      case response => println(response)
    }

No surprise here. The sender reference in this example represents the future that is returned from the `?` method call. But what happens during a replay? During a replay, the sender reference will be `deadLetters` because `Eventsourced` processors don't store sender references in the journal. The main reason for this is that applications usually do not want to redundantly reply to senders during replays.

![Destination reply](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/senderrefs-2.png)

Instead of replying to the sender, the processor can also forward the sender reference to a destination and let the destination reply to the sender. This even works if the destination is wrapped by a channel because a channel simply forwards sender references when delivering event messages to destinations. For that reason, a [ReliableChannel](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.ReliableChannel) needs to store sender references (in contrast to processors). A reliable channel destination can even reply to a sender that was sending an event message in a previous application run (e.g. before the application crashed). If that sender doesn't exist any more after recovery, the reply will go to `deadLetters`.

    class Processor(destination: ActorRef) extends Actor {
      var counter = 0

      def receive = {
        case msg: Message => {
          // …
          // forward modified event message to destination (together with sender reference)
          destination forward msg.copy(event = "processed %d event messages so far" format counter)
        }
      }
    }

    class Destination extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case msg: Message => {
          // …
          // reply to sender
          sender ! ("done processing event = %s (%d)" format msg.event)
        }
      }
    }

    val destination: ActorRef = system.actorOf(Props[Destination])
    val channel: ActorRef = extension.channelOf(DefaultChannelProps(1, destination))
    val processor: ActorRef = extension.processorOf(Props(new Processor(channel) with Eventsourced { val id = 1 } ))

When using a [MessageEmitter](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.MessageEmitter) (see also section [Emitter](#emitter)) applications can choose between methods `sendEvent` and `forwardEvent` where `sendEvent` takes an implicit sender reference as parameter and `forwardEvent` forwards the current sender reference. They work in the same way as the `!` and `forward` methods on `ActorRef`, respectively.

Code from this section is contained in [SenderReferences.scala](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-examples/src/main/scala/org/eligosource/eventsourced/guide/SenderReferences.scala) and can be executed from the sbt prompt with

Channels
--------

A channel is an actor that keeps track of successfully delivered event messages. Channels are used by event-sourced actors (processors) to prevent redundant message delivery to destinations during event message replay. See also section [External Updates](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html#ExternalUpdates) in Martin Fowler's [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) article as well as section [Channel usage](#step-5-channel-usage) in the [First steps](#first-steps) guide for an example.

Currently, the library provides two different channel implementations, [DefaultChannel](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.DefaultChannel) and [ReliableChannel](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.ReliableChannel), and a pattern on top of `ReliableChannel`, a [reliable request-reply channel](#reliable-request-reply-channel). These are explained in the following subsections.

### `DefaultChannel`

![Default channel](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/channels-1.png)

A default channel is a transient channel that delivers event messages to a destination actor. When the destination confirms the delivery of an event message by calling either `confirm()` or `confirm(true)` on the received `Message` object, a confirmation (an *acknowledgement*) is asynchronously written to the journal. During a replay, event messages for which a confirmation exists won't be delivered again to the destination.

Event messages that are negatively confirmed by the destination (via a call to `confirm(false)` on the received event message) will be re-delivered during the next event message replay. This is also the case for event messages for which no confirmation has been made. Therefore, in cases of negative or missing confirmations, the order of event messages received by a destination from a default channel may differ from the order of event messages produced by an event-sourced processor.

A `DefaultChannel` is created and registered at an `EventsourcingExtension` as follows.

    val extension: EventsourcingExtension = …
    val destination: ActorRef = …
    val channelId: Int = …

    val channel: ActorRef = extension.channelOf(DefaultChannelProps(channelId, destination))

The `channelId` must be a positive integer and consistently defined across application runs. The map of registered channels can be obtained via the `channels` method of `EventsourcingExtension` which returns a map of type `Map[Int, ActorRef]` where the mapping key is the channel id. Channels can optionally be registered under a custom name (see also section [Emitter](#emitter)).

    // …
    val channelId: Int = …
    val channelName: String = …

    val channel: ActorRef = extension.channelOf(DefaultChannelProps(channelId, destination).withName(channelName))

The map of registered named channels can be obtained via the `namedChannels` method which returns a map of type `Map[String, ActorRef]` where the mapping key is the channel name.

### `ReliableChannel`

![Reliable channel](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/channels-2.png)

A reliable channel is a persistent channel that writes event messages to a journal before delivering them to a destination actor. In contrast to a default channel, a reliable channel preserves the order of messages as produced by an event-sourced processor and attempts to re-deliver event messages on destination failures. Therefore, a reliable channel enables applications to recover from temporary destination failures without having to run an event message replay.

If a destination positively confirms the receipt of an event message, the stored message is removed from the channel and the next one is delivered. If a destination negatively confirms the receipt of an event message or if no confirmation is made (i.e. a timeout occurs), a re-delivery attempt is made after a certain *redelivery delay*. If the maximum number of re-delivery attempts have been made, the channel restarts itself after a certain *restart delay* and starts again with re-deliveries. If the maximum number of restarts has been reached, the channel stops message delivery and publishes a [DeliveryStopped](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Channel$$DeliveryStopped) event to the event stream of the actor system this channel belongs to. Applications can then re-activate the channel by calling the `deliver(Int)` method of `EventsourcingExtension` with the channel id as argument. Refer to the [ReliableChannel](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.ReliableChannel) API docs for details.

A `ReliableChannel` is created and registered in the same way as a default channel except that a [ReliableChannelProps](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.ReliableChannelProps) configuration object is used.

    // …
    val channel: ActorRef = extension.channelOf(ReliableChannelProps(channelId, destination))

This configuration object additionally allows applications to configure a [RedeliveryPolicy](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.RedeliveryPolicy) for the channel.

### Reliable request-reply channel

![Reliable request-reply channel](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/channels-3.png)

A reliable request-reply channel is a pattern implemented on top of a [reliable channel](#reliablechannel). It mediates reliable request-reply interactions between a request sender (usually an `Eventsourced` processor) and a destination. This channel has the following properties in addition to a plain reliable channel. It

- extracts requests from received [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message)s before sending them to the destination.
- wraps replies from the destination into a `Message` before sending them back to the request sender.
- sends a special [DestinationNotResponding](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.patterns.DestinationNotResponding) reply to the request sender if the destination doesn't reply within a configurable reply timeout.
- sends a special [DestinationFailure](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.patterns.DestinationFailure) reply to the request sender if destination responds with `Status.Failure`.
- guarantees at-least-once delivery of replies to the request sender (in addition to at-least-once delivery of requests to the destination).
- requires a positive receipt confirmation for a reply to mark a request-reply interaction as successfully completed.
- redelivers requests, and subsequently replies, on missing or negative receipt confirmations.

A reliable request-reply channel is created and registered in the same way as a reliable channel except that a [ReliableRequestReplyChannelProps](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.patterns.ReliableRequestReply$ReliableRequestReplyChannelProps) configuration object is used.

    // …
    import org.eligosource.eventsourced.patterns.reliable.requestreply._

    val channel: ActorRef = extension.channelOf(ReliableRequestReplyChannelProps(channelId, destination))

This configuration object additionally allows applications to configure a `replyTimeout` for replies from the destination. A detailed usage example of a reliable request-reply channel is given in [this article](http://krasserm.blogspot.com/2013/01/event-sourcing-and-external-service.html).

### Usage hints

For channels to work properly, event-sourced processors must copy the `processorId` and `sequenceNr` values from a received (and journaled) input event message to output event messages. This is usually done by calling `copy()` on the received input event message and updating only those fields that are relevant for the application such as `event` or `ack`, for example:

    class Processor(channel: ActorRef) extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case msg: Message => {
          // …
          channel ! msg.copy(event = …, ack = …)
        }
      }
    }

When using a [message emitter](#emitter), this is done automatically.

### Alternatives

A less reliable alternative to channels is communication via sender references. This means producing event messages to destinations that have been passed to a processor via sender references (along with an input event message). These sender references will be `deadLetters` during a replay which also prevents redundant delivery. The main difference, however, is that the delivery guarantee changes from *at-least-once* to *at-most-once*.

Recovery
--------

Recovery is a procedure that re-creates the state of event-sourced applications consisting of [Eventsourced](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Eventsourced) actors (processors) and [channels](#channels). Recovery is usually done at application start, either after normal termination or after a crash.

    val system: ActorSystem = …
    val journal: ActorRef = …

    val extension = EventsourcingExtension(system, journal)

    // create and register event-sourced processors
    extension.processorOf(…)
    // …

    // create and register channels
    extension.channelOf(…)
    // …

    // recover state of registered processors and activate channels
    extension.recover()

    // processors and channels are now ready to use
    // …

The `recover()` method first replays journaled event messages to all registered processors. By replaying the event message history, processors can recover state. Processors that emit event messages to one or more channels will also do so during replay. These channels will either ignore (discard) event messages that have already been successfully delivered (i.e. *acknowledged*) in previous application runs or buffer them for later delivery. After replay, the `recover()` method triggers the delivery of buffered messages by activating channels.

If channels delivered event messages immediately instead of buffering them, delivered event messages could wrongly interleave with replayed event messages. This could lead to inconsistencies in event message ordering across application runs and therefore to inconsistencies in application state. Therefore, recovery must ensure that buffered event messages are only delivered after all replayed event messages have been added to their corresponding processors' mailboxes. This is especially important for the recovery of processors and channels that are connected to cyclic, directed graphs.

The [EventsourcingExtension](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.EventsourcingExtension) also supports event message replay for individual processors (refer to the API docs for details). This can be useful in situations where processors are registered at `extension` after an initial recovery.

    // initial recovery
    extension.recover()

    val processorId: Int = …

    // register another processor after initial recovery
    extension.processorOf(ProcessorProps(processorId, …))

    // replay event messages for that processor individually
    extension.replay(id => if (id == processorId) Some(0) else None) onSuccess {
      case _ => // start using processor ...
    }

A call to `replay` can be omitted if a processor did not journal any event message in previous application runs. Channels can be activated individually with the `deliver(channelId: Int)` method.

### Await processing

The `recover` method waits for replayed messages being added to the corresponding processor mailboxes but does not wait for replayed event messages being processed by these processors. However, any new message sent to any registered processor, after `recover` successfully returned, will be processed after the replayed event messages. Applications that want to wait for processors to complete processing of replayed event messages, should use the `awaitProcessing()` method of [EventsourcingExtension](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.EventsourcingExtension).

    val extension: EventsourcingExtension = …

    extension.recover()
    extension.awaitProcessing()

This can be useful in situations where event-sourced processors maintain state via STM references and the application wants to ensure that the (externally visible) state is fully recovered before accepting new read requests from client applications. By default, the `awaitProcessing()` method waits for all registered processors to complete processing but applications can also specify a subset of registered processors.

### Non-blocking recovery

The `recover` and `awaitProcessing` methods block the calling thread. This may be convenient in scenarios where a main thread wants to recover the state of an event-sourced application before taking any further actions. In other scenarios, for example, where recovery is done for individual child processors (and channels) inside an actor, the non-blocking recovery API should be used:

    val extension: EventsourcingExtension = …

    val future = for {
      _ <- extension.replay(…)
      _ <- extension.deliver(…)            // optional
      _ <- extension.completeProcessing(…) // optional
    } yield ()

    future onSuccess {
      case _ => // event-sourced processors now ready to use …
    }

The futures returned by `replay`, `deliver` and `completeProcessing` are monadically composed with a for-comprehension which ensures a sequential execution of these methods. The composite `future` is completed once all methods have completed their returned futures. More details in the [API docs](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.EventsourcingExtension).

### State dependencies

The behavior of [Eventsourced](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Eventsourced) processors may depend on the state of other `Eventsourced` processors. For example, processor A sends a message to processor B and processor B replies with a message that includes (part of) processor B's state. Depending on the state value included in the reply, processor A may take different actions. To ensure a proper recovery of such a setup, any state-conveying or state-dependent messages exchanged between processors A and B must be of type [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message) (see also [DependentStateRecoverySpec.scala](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-core/src/test/scala/org/eligosource/eventsourced/core/DependentStateRecoverySpec.scala)). Exchanging state via non-journaled messages (i.e. messages of type other than `Message`) can break consistent recovery. This is also the case if an `Eventsourced` processor maintains state via an externally visible STM reference and another `Eventsourced` processor directly reads from that reference. Communication between `Eventsourced` processors is closely related to [external queries](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html#ExternalQueries) and [external updates](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html#ExternalUpdates).

Behavior changes
----------------

Actors that are modified with a stackable `Receiver`, `Emitter` and/or `Eventsourced` trait can change their behavior with the methods `become()` and `unbecome()`. These are defined on the [Behavior](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Behavior) trait from which `Receiver`, `Emitter` and `Eventsourced` inherit.

Actors that change their behavior with `become()` and `unbecome()` will keep the functionality introduced by a stackable `Receiver`, `Emitter` and/or `Eventsourced` trait. For example, an actor that is modified with the `Eventsourced` trait will continue to journal event messages after having changed its behavior with `become()`.

On the other hand, actors that change their behavior with `context.become()` will loose the functionality introduced by the stackable `Receiver`, `Emitter` and/or `Eventsourced` traits (although the lost behavior can be recovered with `context.unbecome()`).

Event series
------------

When a processor derives more than one output event message from a single input event message and emits those output messages to a single channel, it generates a series of event messages. For an event message series, the event processor should set the `ack` field for all but the last emitted message to `false`.

    class Processor(channel: ActorRef) extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case msg: Message => {
          // …
          channel ! msg.copy(event = "event 1", ack = false) // 1st message of series
          channel ! msg.copy(event = "event 2", ack = false) // 2nd message of series
          // …
          channel ! msg.copy(event = "event n") // last message of series
        }
      }
    }

Processors that use an emitter do that in the following way.

    class Processor extends Actor { this: Emitter =>
      def receive = {
        case event => {
          // …
          emitter("channelName") send (msg => msg.copy(event = "event 1", ack = false)) // 1st message of series
          emitter("channelName") send (msg => msg.copy(event = "event 2", ack = false)) // 2nd message of series
          // …
          emitter("channelName") sendEvent "event n"
        }
      }
    }

This ensures that an acknowledgement is only written to the journal after the last message of a series has been successfully

- delivered by a [default channel](#defaultchannel) or
- stored by a [reliable channel](#reliablechannel)

Destinations, however, should confirm the receipt of every event message, regardless whether it belongs to a series or not.

Idempotency
-----------

Under certain failure conditions, [channels](#channels) may deliver event messages to destinations more than once. A typical example is that a destination positively confirms a message receipt but the application crashes shortly before that confirmation can be written to the journal. In this case, the destination will receive the event message again during recovery.

For these (but also other) reasons, channel destinations must be idempotent event message consumers which is an application-level concern. For example, an event message consumer that stores received purchase orders in a map (where the map key is the order id) is likely to be an idempotent consumer because receiving a purchase order only once or several times will lead to the same result: the purchase order is contained in the map only once. An event message consumer that counts the number of received purchase orders is not an idempotent consumer: a re-delivery will lead to a wrong counter value from a business logic perspective. In this case the event message consumer must implement some extra means to detect event message *duplicates*.

For detecting duplicates, applications should use identifiers with their events. Identifier values should be set by an event-sourced processor before an event is emitted via a channel. Channel destinations (or other downstream consumers) should keep track of identifiers of successfully processed events and compare them to identifiers of newly received events. A newly received event with an already known identifier can be considered as a duplicate (assuming that the emitting processor generates unique identifiers). For generating unique identifiers, processors can use the sequence number of received event messages:

    case class MyEvent(details: Any, eventId: Long)

    class Processor extends Actor { this: Emitter with Eventsourced =>
      def receive = {
        case event => {
          // get sequence number of current event message
          val snr: Long = sequenceNr
          val details: Any = …
          // …
          emitter("channelName") sendEvent MyEvent(details, snr)
        }
      }
    }

Using the sequence number has the advantage that consumers of emitted events only need to remember the identifier of the last successfully consumed event. If the identifier of a newly received event is less than or equal to that of the last consumed event then it is a duplicate and can therefore be ignored.

    class Consumer extends Actor {
      var lastEventId = 0L

      def receive = {
        case MyEvent(details, eventId) =>
          if (eventId <= lastEventId) {
            // duplicate
          } else {
            // ...
            lastEventId = eventId
          }
      }
    }

Consumers that are event-sourced processors can store the event identifier as part of their state which will be recovered during an event message replay. Other consumers must store the identifier somewhere else.

Processors that emit [event message series](#event-series) should use an event message index in addition to the sequence number to uniquely identify an emitted event:

    case class MyEvent(details: Any, eventId: (Long, Int))

    class Processor extends Actor { this: Emitter with Eventsourced =>
      def receive = {
        case event => {
          // get sequence number of current event message
          val snr: Long = sequenceNr
          val details: Seq[Any] = …
          // …
          emitter("channelName") send (msg => msg.copy(event = MyEvent(details(0), (snr, 0)), ack = false))
          emitter("channelName") send (msg => msg.copy(event = MyEvent(details(1), (snr, 1)), ack = false))
          // …
        }
      }
    }

Consumers should then compare the sequence number - index pairs for detecting duplicates.

Serialization
-------------

Applications can configure custom serializers for events of event `Message`s. Custom serializers are used for both, writing the event to a journal and for remote communication. They can be configured like any other [Akka serializer](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.1.0/scala/serialization.html). For example:

    akka {
      actor {
        serializers {
          custom = "example.MyEventSerializer"
        }
        serialization-bindings {
          "example.MyEvent" = custom
        }
      }
    }

Here, `example.MyEvent` is an application-specific event type and `example.MyEventSerializer` is an application-specific serializer that extends `akka.serialization.Serializer`

    import akka.serialization.Serializer

    class CustomEventSerializer extends Serializer {
      def identifier = …
      def includeManifest = true

      def toBinary(o: AnyRef) = …
      def fromBinary(bytes: Array[Byte], manifest: Option[Class[_]]) = …
    }

Event [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message)s themselves are serialized with a [pre-configured](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-core/src/main/resources/reference.conf#L4), library-specific serializer. This serializer is automatically used for event `Message`s when the `eventsourced-*.jar` is on the classpath of an Akka application.

Further examples
----------------

### Order management

The order management example in this section is taken from [Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com/)'s great [LMAX article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html):

> Imagine you are making an order for jelly beans by credit card. A simple retailing system would take your order information, use a credit card validation service to check your credit card number, and then confirm your order - all within a single operation. The thread processing your order would block while waiting for the credit card to be checked, but that block wouldn't be very long for the user, and the server can always run another thread on the processor while it's waiting.
>
> In the LMAX architecture, you would split this operation into two. The first operation would capture the order information and finish by outputting an event (credit card validation requested) to the credit card company. The Business Logic Processor would then carry on processing events for other customers until it received a credit-card-validated event in its input event stream. On processing that event it would carry out the confirmation tasks for that order.

This can be implemented with the Eventsourced library as shown in the following diagram (legend is in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-legend)).

![Order management](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/ordermgnt-1.png)

- We implement the mentioned *Business Logic Processor* processor as event-sourced actor (`OrderProcessor`). It processes `OrderSubmitted` events by assigning submitted orders an id and storing them in a map (= state of `OrderProcessor`). For every submitted order it emits a `CreditCardValidationRequested` event.
- `CreditCardValidationRequested` events are processed by a `CreditCardValidator` actor. It contacts an external credit card validation service and sends `CreditCardValidated` events back to the `OrderProcessor` for every order with a valid credit card number. In the example implementation below, we won't actually use an external service to keep the implementation simple, but for real-world implementations, [akka-camel](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.1.0/scala/camel.html) would be a perfect fit here.
- On receiving a `CreditCardValidated` event, the event-sourced `OrderProcessor` updates the status of corresponding order to `validated = true` and sends an `OrderAccepted` event, containing the updated order, to `Destination`. It also replies the updated order to the initial sender.

The `Order` domain object, the domain events and the `OrderProcessor` are defined as follows:

    // domain object
    case class Order(id: Int = -1, details: String, validated: Boolean = false, creditCardNumber: String)

    // domain events
    case class OrderSubmitted(order: Order)
    case class OrderAccepted(order: Order)
    case class CreditCardValidationRequested(order: Order)
    case class CreditCardValidated(orderId: Int)

    // event-sourced order processor
    class OrderProcessor extends Actor { this: Emitter =>
      var orders = Map.empty[Int, Order] // processor state

      def receive = {
        case OrderSubmitted(order) => {
          val id = orders.size
          val upd = order.copy(id = id)
          orders = orders + (id -> upd)
          emitter("validation_requests") forwardEvent CreditCardValidationRequested(upd)
        }
        case CreditCardValidated(orderId) => {
          orders.get(orderId).foreach { order =>
            val upd = order.copy(validated = true)
            orders = orders + (orderId -> upd)
            sender ! upd
            emitter("accepted_orders") sendEvent OrderAccepted(upd)
          }
        }
      }
    }

The `OrderProcessor` uses a message `emitter` to send `CreditCardValidationRequested` events to `CreditCardValidator` via the named `"validation_requests"` channel. The `forwardEvent` method not only sends the event but also forwards the initial [sender reference](#sender-references). Upon receiving a `CreditCardValidationRequested` event, the `CreditCardValidator` runs a credit card validation in the background and sends a `CreditCardValidated` event back to the `OrderProcessor`

    class CreditCardValidator(orderProcessor: ActorRef) extends Actor { this: Receiver =>
      def receive = {
        case CreditCardValidationRequested(order) => {
          val sdr = sender  // initial sender
          val msg = message // current event message
          Future {
            // do some credit card validation
            // ...

            // and send back a successful validation result (preserving the initial sender)
            orderProcessor tell (msg.copy(event = CreditCardValidated(order.id)), sdr)
          }
        }
      }
    }


The `CreditCardValidator` again forwards the initial sender reference which finally enables the `OrderProcessor` to reply to the initial sender when it receives the `CreditCardValidated` event. The `OrderProcessor` also sends an `OrderAccepted` event to `Destination` via the named `"accepted_orders"` channel.

    class Destination extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case event => println("received event %s" format event)
      }
    }

Next step is to wire the collaborators and to recover them:

    val extension: EventsourcingExtension = …

    val processor = extension.processorOf(Props(new OrderProcessor with Emitter with Confirm with Eventsourced { val id = 1 }))
    val validator = system.actorOf(Props(new CreditCardValidator(processor) with Receiver))
    val destination = system.actorOf(Props(new Destination with Receiver with Confirm))

    extension.channelOf(ReliableChannelProps(1, validator).withName("validation_requests"))
    extension.channelOf(DefaultChannelProps(2, destination).withName("accepted_orders"))

    extension.recover()

The named `"validation requests"` channel is a reliable channel that re-delivers `CreditCardValidationRequested` events in case of `CreditCardValidator` failures (for example, when the external credit card validation service is temporarily unavailable). Furthermore, it should be noted that the `CreditCardValidator` does not confirm event message deliveries (it neither calls `confirm()` explicitly nor is it modified with the `Confirm` trait during instantiation). Delivery confirmation will take place when the `OrderProcessor` successfully processed the `CreditCardValidated` event.

The `Order processor` is now ready to receive `OrderSubmitted` events.

    processor ? Message(OrderSubmitted(Order(details = "jelly beans", creditCardNumber = "1234-5678-1234-5678"))) onSuccess {
      case order: Order => println("received response %s" format order)
    }

Running this example with an empty journal will write

    received response Order(0,jelly beans,true,1234-5678-1234-5678)
    received event OrderAccepted(Order(0,jelly beans,true,1234-5678-1234-5678))

to `stdout`. You may observe a different line ordering when running the example. The submitted order was assigned an `id` of `0` which corresponds to the initial size of the `OrderProcessor`'s `orders` map. A second application run will first recover the previous application state, so that another order submission will generate an order `id` of `1`.

    received response Order(1,jelly beans,true,1234-5678-1234-5678)
    received event OrderAccepted(Order(1,jelly beans,true,1234-5678-1234-5678))

The example code is contained in [OrderExample.scala](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-examples/src/main/scala/org/eligosource/eventsourced/example/OrderExample.scala) and can be executed from the sbt prompt with

    > project eventsourced-examples
    > run-nobootcp org.eligosource.eventsourced.example.OrderExample

An advanced version of this example, using a [reliable request-reply channel](#reliable-request-reply-channel), is discussed in [Event sourcing and external service integration](http://krasserm.blogspot.com/2013/01/event-sourcing-and-external-service.html).

### State machines

![State machines](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/statemachines-1.png)

With a [change](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/akka/tickets/2680) since Akka 2.1, event-sourcing Akka [FSM](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.1.0/scala/fsm.html)s is now pretty easy. The following state machine example is a `Door` which can be in one of two states: `Open` and `Closed`.

    sealed trait DoorState

    case object Open extends DoorState
    case object Closed extends DoorState

    case class DoorMoved(state: DoorState, times: Int)
    case class DoorNotMoved(state: DoorState, cmd: String)
    case class NotSupported(cmd: Any)

    class Door extends Actor with FSM[DoorState, Int] { this: Emitter =>
      startWith(Closed, 0)

      when(Closed) {
        case Event("open", counter) => {
          emit(DoorMoved(Open, counter + 1))
          goto(Open) using(counter + 1)
        }
      }

      when(Open) {
        case Event("close", counter) => {
          emit(DoorMoved(Closed, counter + 1))
          goto(Closed) using(counter + 1)
        }
      }

      whenUnhandled {
        case Event(cmd @ ("open" | "close"), counter) => {
          emit(DoorNotMoved(stateName, "cannot %s door" format cmd))
          stay
        }
        case Event(cmd, counter) => {
          emit(NotSupported(cmd))
          stay
        }
      }

      def emit(event: Any) = emitter("destination") forwardEvent event
    }

On state changes, a door emits `DoorMoved` events to the named `"destination"` channel. `DoorMoved` events contain the door's current state and the number of moves so far. On invalid attempts to move a door e.g. trying to open an opened door, a `DoorNotMoved` event is emitted. The channel destination is an actor that simply prints received events to `stdout`.

    class Destination extends Actor {
      def receive = { case event => println("received event %s" format event) }
    }

After configuring the application

    val system: ActorSystem = …
    val extension: EventsourcingExtension = …

    val destination = system.actorOf(Props(new Destination with Receiver with Confirm))

    extension.channelOf(DefaultChannelProps(1, destination).withName("destination"))
    extension.processorOf(Props(new Door with Emitter with Eventsourced { val id = 1 } ))
    extension.recover()

    val door = extension.processors(1)

we can start sending event messages to `door`:

    door ! Message("open")
    door ! Message("close")

This will write

    received event DoorMoved(Open,1)
    received event DoorMoved(Closed,2)

to `stdout`. When trying to attempt an invalid state change with

    door ! Message("close")

the `destination` will receive a `DoorNotMoved` event:

    received event DoorNotMoved(Closed,cannot close door)

Restarting the example application will recover the door's state so that

    door ! Message("open")
    door ! Message("close")

will produce

    received event DoorMoved(Open,3)
    received event DoorMoved(Closed,4)

The code from this section is contained in slightly modified form in [FsmExample.scala](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-core-test/src/test/scala/org/eligosource/eventsourced/core/FsmSpec.scala).

### Clustering

This section makes the `Door` state machine from the [previous example](#state-machines) highly-available in an Akka [cluster](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.1.0/cluster/index.html). The `Door` state machine is a cluster-wide singleton that is managed by `NodeActor`s. There's one `NodeActor` per cluster node listening to cluster events. If a `NodeActor` becomes the master (= leader) it creates and recovers a `Door` instance. The other `NodeActor`s obtain a remote reference to the `Door` instance on master.

![Clustering1](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/clustering-1.png)

Clients interact with the `Door` singleton via `NodeActor`s by sending them door commands (`"open"` or `"close"`). `NodeActor`s accept commands on any cluster node, not only on master. A `NodeActor` forwards these commands to the `Door` as command [Message](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Message)s. Event `Message`s emitted by the `Door` are sent to a remote `Destination` actor via the named `"destination"` channel. The `Destination` creates a response from the received events and sends that response back to the initial sender. The application that runs the `Destination` actor is not part of the cluster but a standalone remote application. It also hosts the journal that is used by the cluster nodes (which is a SPOF in this example but later versions will use a distributed journal).

When the master crashes, another node in the cluster becomes the master and recovers the `Door` state machine. The remaining slave node renews its remote reference to the `Door` instance on the new master.

![Clustering2](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/clustering-2.png)

Code from this section is contained in [ClusterExample.scala](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-examples/src/main/scala/org/eligosource/eventsourced/example/ClusterExample.scala), the configuration files used are [journal.conf](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-examples/src/main/resources/journal.conf) and [cluster.conf](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/blob/master/es-examples/src/main/resources/cluster.conf). For a more detailed description of the example code, refer to the code comments. To run the distributed example application from sbt, first start the application that hosts the `Destination` actor and the journal:

    > run-main org.eligosource.eventsourced.example.Destination

Then start the first seed node of the cluster

    > run-main org.eligosource.eventsourced.example.Node 2561

then the second seed node

    > run-main org.eligosource.eventsourced.example.Node 2562

and finally a third cluster node

    > run-main org.eligosource.eventsourced.example.Node

The above commands require that you're in the `eventsourced-examples` project. You can switch to it via

    > project eventsourced-examples

Most likely the first seed node will become the master which writes

    MASTER: recovered door at akka://node@127.0.0.1:2561

to `stdout`. The other nodes become slaves that write

    SLAVE: referenced door at akka://node@127.0.0.1:2561

to `stdout`. All nodes prompt the user to enter a door command:

    command (open|close):

We will now enter commands on the last started cluster node (a slave node).

The `Door` singleton is initially in closed state. Entering `open` will open it:

    command (open|close): open
    moved 1 times: door now open

Then close it again:

    command (open|close): close
    moved 2 times: door now closed

Trying to close a closed door will result in an error:

    command (open|close): close
    cannot close door: door is closed

Now kill the master node with `ctrl^c`. This will also destroy the `Door` singleton. After 1-2 seconds, a new master has been determined by the cluster. The new master is going to recover the event-sourced `Door` singleton. The slave will renew its remote reference to the `Door`. To verify that the `Door` has been properly recovered, open the door again:

    command (open|close): open
    moved 3 times: door now open

You can see that the `Door` state (which contains the number of past moves) has been properly failed-over.

Miscellaneous

### Multicast processor

![Multicast](https://raw.github.com/eligosource/eventsourced/master/doc/images/multicast-1.png)

The [Multicast](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.Multicast) processor is a predefined `Eventsourced` processor that forwards received event messages to multiple targets. Using a `Multicast` processor with n targets is an optimization of having n `Eventsourced` processors that receive the same event `Message`s. Using a multicast processor, a received event message is journaled only once whereas with n `Eventsourced` processors that message would be journaled n times (once for each processor). Using a `Multicast` processor for a large number of targets can therefore significantly save disk space and increase throughput.

Applications can create a `Multicast` processor with the `multicast` factory method which is defined in package [core](http://eligosource.github.com/eventsourced/api/snapshot/#org.eligosource.eventsourced.core.package).

    // …
    import org.eligosource.eventsourced.core._

    val extension: EventsourcingExtension = …

    val processorId: Int = …
    val target1: ActorRef = …
    val target2: ActorRef = …

    val multicast = extension.processorOf(Props(multicast(processorId, List(target1, target2))))

This is equivalent to

    val multicast = extension.processorOf(Props(new Multicast(List(target1, target2), identity) with Eventsourced { val id = processorId } ))

Applications that want to modify received event `Message`s, before they are forwarded to targets, can specify a `transformer` function.

    val transformer: Message => Any = msg => msg.event
    val multicast = extension.processorOf(Props(multicast(1, List(target1, target2), transformer)))

In the above example, the `transformer` function extracts the `event` from a received event `Message`. If the `transformer` function is not specified, it defaults to the `identity` function. Another `Multicast` factory method is the `decorator` method for creating a multicast processor with a single target.
