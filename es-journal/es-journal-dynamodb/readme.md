DynamoDB Journal
================

This is the DynamoDB backed Eventsourced Journal implementation.

To use this journal, you will need to create a DynamoDB table in your AWS account. This can be done manually, or with the
table creation utility included in this implementation.

*Note* please take care to provision ample write throughput for your application.

A good rule of thumb is to provision one write unit per eventsourced message per second in your app when using processors and default channels,
and two write units per eventsourced message per second in your app when using processors and reliable channels.

## Configure DynamoDB

Here is an example of using the table creation utility to create a DynamoDB table for your application's journal.
It assumes that your AWS key and secret are set as the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
and that eventsourced and the dynamodb journal implementation are dependencies in your project.

```

The utilities also include a method to scale the throughput of your table up or down.  Since you can only increase throughput by a factor of 2 per api call
the utility takes care of waiting for the table to be active and increasing the throughput again until the target throughputs are reached.

This makes scaling up to do throughput testing straigntforward.

*NOTE* YOU CAN ONLY SCALE DOWN YOUR THROUGHPUT ONCE PER 24HRS. Please be careful when using lots of throughput for testing.


## Using the DynamoDB Journal

Once you have DynamoDB configured properly, you can start using the journal. In addition to the table name, you will need to select
an application name to use with the journal, since one DynamoDB table can support multiple journals concurrently.

Here is a basic example of how you can set up an eventsourced actor system, using the DynamoDB jorunal.

```
import org.eligosource.eventsourced.core._
import org.eligosource.eventsourced.journal.dynamodb.DynamoDBJournalProps
import akka.actor._
import concurrent.duration._

implicit val actorSystem = ActorSystem("example")
implicit val timeout = Timeout(5 seconds)

import system.dispatcher

val key    = sys.env("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
val secret = sys.env("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
val table  = "my-journal-table"
val app    = "my-eventsourced-app"
val props  = DynamoDBJournalProps(table, app, key, secret, asyncWriterCount = 16, system = actorSystem)

// Event sourcing extension
val extension = EventsourcingExtension(system, Journal(props))

// create processors and channels
val p = extension.processorOf(...)
val c = extension.channelOf(...)

//recover application state
extension.recover()

//have at it

p ! Message("go-go")

```
